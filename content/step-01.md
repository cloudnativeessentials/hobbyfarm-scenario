Welcome to Cloud Native Essentials Tutorial at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2023.

In this tutorial we’ll give an overview of CNCF graduated projects, what problems they solved, and how to use them. The tutorial will go through the installation, setup, and use of the following: the container runtime containerd to be used with upstream Kubernetes, the latest version of upstream Kubernetes (including etcd), Harbor for a container registry, Helm to deploy an application, Prometheus for monitoring, fluentd for logging, Open Policy Agent and Gatekeeper for admission control for compliance. After this tutorial, you’ll be well on your way on your cloud native journey.

We will be using two virtual machines today, `harbor` and `kubernetes` which are located in the tabs in the panel to the right. `kubernetes` will run a Kubernetes cluster, and `harbor` will run a Harbor container registry instance.
