Presented at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2023 @ Chicago, IL

## Abstract
Learning about cloud native projects can be difficult and time consuming on your own. This 90 minute tutorial introduces and demystifies many CNCF graduated projects. In this tutorial we’ll give an overview of CNCF graduated projects, what problems they solved, and how to use them. The tutorial will go through the installation, setup, and use of the following: the container runtime containerd to be used with upstream Kubernetes, the latest version of upstream Kubernetes (including etcd), Harbor for a container registry, Helm to deploy an application, Prometheus for monitoring, fluentd for logging, Open Policy Agent and Gatekeeper for admission control for compliance. After this tutorial, you’ll be well on your way on your cloud native journey.
